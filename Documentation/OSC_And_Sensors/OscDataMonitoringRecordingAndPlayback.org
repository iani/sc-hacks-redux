#+TITLE: Osc Data Monitoring, Recording, and Playback

* Recording Osc Data

Open a Gui for recording Osc Data (and audio):

#+begin_src sclang
OscMonitor.gui;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: OscMonitor.gui;

A gui window appears:

[[oscmonitor.png]]

To start recording, click on the button "Record OSC".
The button changes to "Stop Recording OSC"
To stop recording, click on "Stop Recording OSC".

The data are recorded in the default directory for supercollider audio recordings.  This can be found by this code:

#+begin_src sclang
Platform.recordingsDir;
#+end_src

* Loading and Playing back OSC data

*NOTE: The data for running the examples here are found in the present folder in file: [[oscdata.scd]]*

** Load recorded osc data from a file

#+begin_src sclang
OscDataReader.openDialog;
#+end_src

Select multiple contiguous files from a session folder, and click OK.

** Playback recorded osc data.

#+begin_src sclang
// make a player
p = OscDataReader.makePlayer;
// play back all data
p.play;
// alternatively, play back only selected messages:
p.playSelect(['/minibee', '/code']);
#+end_src

* Displaying data playback on a window

There is a simple gui system for displaying data from messages set in the following fixed format:

=[/message, id, x, y, z]=

The gui system can handle messages with an id between 0 and about 30, displaying x, y and z as dots on a multislider.  For this, the range values of x, y and z must be normalized (they must always be in the range between 0 and 1.).

If the values of the message sent by the sensors are in a range other than 0 to 1, then it is possible to normalize these and send them again to sclang under a new message name.  This is done through class MapXyz like this:




is in the

Example:

For messages of the format

#+begin_src sclang
[/minibee, 0, x, y, z]
#+end_src

Prepare sc to listen to =/minibee= and to notify the gui and set sensors:

#+begin_src sclang
// prepare for listening to ID numbers from 0 to 11:
InputXyz enable: 12; // note: this boots the server and writes to control busses
// Prepare to display messages matching '/minibee'
InputXyz.addMessage('/minibee');
// Open Gui
InputXyz.gui;
// Load some data from file
OscDataReader.openDialog;
//:create a playsr
p = OscDataReader.makePlayer;
// play back the data, selecting only messages that match '/minibee'
p.playSelect(['/minibee']);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
// prepare for listening to ID numbers from 0 to 11:
InputXyz enable: 12; // note: this boots the server and writes to control busses
// Prepare to display messages matching '/minibee'
InputXyz.addMessage('/minibee');
// Open Gui
InputXyz.gui;
// Load some data from file
OscDataReader.openDialog;
//:create a playsr
p = OscDataReader.makePlayer;
// play back the data, selecting only messages that match '/minibee'
p.playSelect(['/minibee']);
#+end_example
