Draft of Methods extending functionaly of Chord.

As shown by the sections below, there are too many different features and combinations to attempt a systematic combination straightaway.

Instead, we proceed by developing a series of characteristic examples.

* EXAMPLES !?



* A. deriving modified versions of a chord
** transpose
** transposex
** scale
** scalex
* B. exporting frequencies to environment / busses
** 1. Writing single frequencies as single environment variables
** 2. Writing and array of frequences in a single environment variable
** 3. Writing Frequenceies into busses - with generated or given names
** 4. Writing frequencies into named allocated buffers
** 5. Setting frequencies in synths
* C. composing chords

Creating the unions or intersections of midi / frequency arrays.

* D. creating sequences of chords

- With x-line tranistions

* E. playing with different types of source synths
