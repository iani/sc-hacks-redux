By default inside the projects folder (default: ~/sc-projects), in subfolder =AudioSampleEvents=.

At the top level below =AudioSampleEvents= are folders corresponding to "Sets", where each folder contains a set consisting of playfuncs and of event configurations for playing

#+begin_example
sc-projects
     AudioSampleEvents  // contains all sets, each set in its own folder
          Set1          // contains Playfuncs and Event settings
              Playfuncs // contains the playfuncs
                    playfunc1.scd  // a playfunc - see example below
                    playfunc2.scd
              Settings  // contains settings organized by buffer name.
                    crickets // contains setttings for buffer =\crickets=
                          crickets00.scd // example of event settings - see below.

** playfunc example

#+begin_src sclang
{
	PlayBuf.ar(
		~buf.buf.numChannels,
		~buf.buf,
		\rate.br(~rate ? 1),
		\trigger.br(1),
		\startpos.br(~startpos ? 0),
		\loop.br(~loop ? 0),
		Done.freeSelf
	)
}

** event settings example

#+begin_src sclang
// the next line is implied by the folder name in which the file is based:
// ~buf = \crickets;

~synthfunc = \playbuf; // which playfunc to use
// ~startpos = ... // additional parameter settings
