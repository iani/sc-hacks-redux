* Installation
* The Mediator Environment

The Mediator is a variant of ProxySpace that uses a custom dispatch method for replacing the values of its environment variables.  It introduces custom behaviors for replacing synths and patterns, so that storing a synth or pattern in an environment variable automatically stops the previously running synth or pattern.

Examples:

* Patterns and Synths in Mediator Envionment
* EventStream

The EventStream class is an alternative to Pbind.  It is named EventStream because it is a Stream that produces Events.  It replaces the Event producing Routine (formally referred to as Event Stream) that is produced by Pbind.  This is because a Routine does not allow access to its closure variables, and therefore does not permit changing parts of the stream.
