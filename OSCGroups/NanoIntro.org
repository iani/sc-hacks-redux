Nano introduction to trying sc-hacks-redux, 
also as a way of sharing code via OSCGroups.

A copy of this file in scd is also found in folder Demo210526.

* operators: =+>=, =++>=
** =+>= Send a new sound to a player and start playing

=+>= sends a Function or an Event to a player, and starts playing it. 

#+begin_src sclang
{ PinkNoise.ar(0.1).dup } +> \test; // play a function. creates a synth
(degree: Pseq((0..7)), dur: 0.1) +> \test; // play an event. creates EventStream
(degree: Pbrown(-10, 10, 2, dur: 1/3) +> \test; // play a different event
{ WhiteNoise.ar(0.1).dup } +> \test; // play a different function
#+end_src

Here the player is named =\test=
The Event or Function that you send to that player stops anything currently playing in that player, and starts something new.

** =++>= Add some keys-values to a pattern and start playing

#+begin_src sclang
{ PinkNoise.ar(0.1).dup } +> \test; // play a function. creates a synth
(degree: Pseq((0..7))) ++> \test; // start an event, replacing the function
(dur: 0.05) ++> \test; // Add a stream tp the eventstream while it is playing
// Add a stream tp the eventstream while it is playing
(dur: Prand([0.05 !! 20, 0.1 !! 10, 0.2 !! 5, 0.5 !! 2, 1]) ++> \test;
#+end_src

* messages: =stop=, =start=


#+begin_src sclang
(degree: Pseq((0..7)), dur: 0.1) +> \test; // start a pattern in player \test;
\test.stop // stop player \test
\test.start // start player \test
#+end_src

Currently works only with patterns. Cannot restart synths.
