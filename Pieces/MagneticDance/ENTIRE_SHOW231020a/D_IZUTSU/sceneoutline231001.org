#+TITLE: Sceneoutline231001

Hi Iannis

Hope you are back and take a rest bit.
Anyway we have rushy time till the premiere.
Regards to the order of the scence,
I would like to suggesgt like as following.

Izutsu  scene order

1. Asayo introducing
2. Introduction
3. Jun solo-Narihira
4. Contact
5. Image Projection 1  time
6. Ghost Duet
7. Image projection 2
8. Asayo solo~unison millor

I think we need one more projection after Contact.
I request the projection for the image of “time”
After they met and felt in love, time past many years. So we want to express time in projection 1.

And about the stage, if the normal stage is set the edge of the space, its better to us as it is.
And audience sets one side. And the projection shoot on the wall.

How do you think?

Best
JUN TAKAHASHI
