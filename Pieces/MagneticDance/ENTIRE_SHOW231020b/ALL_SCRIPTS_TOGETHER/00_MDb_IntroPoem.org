** Adaptation Iannis

Beautiful, the Naïad Liriope, taken by force under the river…
Beautiful, Narcissus, born from this violent water…
Beautiful the words of Echo, leading her to the silence of a cave…

Beauty is often wasted in loneliness despite being surrounded by admiration.
This is the story of Echo and Narcissus,
a story of fate,
sealed by ignorance, and obsessive passion.

How many souls linger forgotten in the eternity of water untouched?
Words are too much, but also not enough.

Those that could not find each other in flesh,
are unified at last and forever,
through the vibration of a chanting breeze carrying the slight smell of a flower.
